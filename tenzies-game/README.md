# 🎲 Tenzies Game – React

A modern and interactive **Tenzies game** built with **React**.
The goal is to roll 10 dice until they all show the same number.
You can "hold" dice to keep their value between rolls. A fun and visual game that demonstrates core React concepts, state management, and basic game logic.

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Click the **Roll** button to roll all dice.
2. Click on any die to **hold** it — it won’t be rolled again.
3. Continue rolling until **all dice show the same number** and are held.
4. 🎉 **Confetti** appears when you win. Click "New Game" to restart.
