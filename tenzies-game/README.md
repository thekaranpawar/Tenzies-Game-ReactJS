🎲 Tenzies Game – React
A modern and interactive Tenzies game built with React.
The goal is to roll 10 dice until they all show the same number.
You can "hold" dice to keep their value between rolls. A fun and visual game that demonstrates core React concepts, state management, and basic game logic.

🕹️ How to Play
Click the Roll button to roll all dice.
Click on any die to hold it — it won’t be rolled again.
Continue rolling until all dice show the same number and are held.
🎉 Confetti appears when you win. Click "New Game" to restart.

⚙️ Tech Stack
React – Frontend UI Library
React Confetti – Celebration animation
Custom Image Assets – Dice face images (diceFace1.png to diceFace6.png)
CSS – Styling and layout
📚 Learning Objectives
Through building this project, the following skills and concepts were practiced:

⚛️ Building components and managing state with React
🎯 Using useEffect for side effects and win condition logic
🧩 Structuring React projects with reusable components
🎉 Integrating third-party packages like react-confetti
🖼️ Handling image assets and dynamic rendering
🧪 Creating a simple game loop with conditional rendering
